# Structural Convergence

> A design philosophy for the AgentCraft "Nexus A" logo.

---

Form emerges at the meeting point of forces. Where lines cross, meaning crystallizes. **Structural Convergence** celebrates the intersection as the fundamental unit of visual communication — not the line itself, but the point where trajectories collide and create something greater than their parts. In this philosophy, a single convergence node carries more visual weight than a hundred isolated strokes. Every mark exists to participate in a crossing; every crossing exists to anchor the composition.

Composition is governed by directional tension: multiple vectors aimed at shared focal points, creating natural hierarchies of density. Where more lines converge, visual gravity increases; where fewer cross, openness and breathing room prevail. This interplay produces an organic gradient from dense structural anchors to airy peripheries — a rhythm of compression and release that rewards patient viewing. The result must appear as though it emerged from countless hours of geometric meditation, each angle calibrated with the deliberation of a master architect drafting a blueprint.

Color is subordinate to structure. The design exists first as pure monochromatic line work — medium-independent, scalable from a 16-pixel favicon to a billboard. Whether rendered in ink on paper, light on screen, or etched into metal, the visual integrity remains absolute. Color, when applied, is a garment the structure wears, never its skin. This principle ensures the logo serves equally well in black-on-white documents, white-on-dark interfaces, or any brand-accent scenario.

Space between lines carries equal importance to the lines themselves. The counter-forms — the triangular void at the heart of the letter, the gaps between diverging trajectories — are designed with the same painstaking care as the positive marks. Master-level execution demands that these negative shapes are as beautiful and intentional as the strokes that define them. The counter is not absence; it is silence between notes, load-bearing emptiness in an arch.

The intersection nodes — small, precise circles marking where paths cross — are the signature detail. They transform abstract line work into a network graph, evoking connectivity, orchestration, and the convergence of independent agents toward a shared purpose. Each node is placed with the precision of a cartographer plotting coordinates, the product of deep expertise and meticulous craftsmanship. Together, lines and nodes form a visual language of convergence that is unmistakably structural, undeniably intentional, and endlessly adaptable.

## Logo Variants & Usage

Three raster variants are cropped from the master design sheet (`preview-sheet.png`) with transparent backgrounds:

| File | Dimensions | Description | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `logo-full-brand.png` | 256×354 | Small icon + **Actant** + *Nexus A* subtitle | Documents, footers, about pages, print materials where full brand identity is needed |
| `logo-primary.png` | 404×543 | Large icon + **Actant** wordmark | Hero sections, splash screens, README headers, landing pages |
| `logo-icon-only.png` | 270×277 | Nexus A mark only (no text) | Favicons, avatars, toolbar icons, compact UI, social media profiles |

Vector originals remain in `nexus-a*.svg` for resolution-independent rendering. Sized PNG icons (`icon-{16,24,32,48,64,128,256}.png`) are generated from SVG via `generate.py`.
