# Ship Testing Convention

During `/trellis-ship` (Phase 1 review), run **incremental tests** instead of the full suite:

- Use `pnpm test:changed` (vitest `--changed`) which only runs tests related to uncommitted changes
- Only fall back to `pnpm test` (full suite) when explicitly requested or when changes touch shared infrastructure (e.g. vitest.config.ts, tsconfig, package.json dependencies)
